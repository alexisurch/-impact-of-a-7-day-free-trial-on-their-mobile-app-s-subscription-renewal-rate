In this endeavour, I explored the impact of a 7-day free trial on their mobile app's subscription renewal rate. üí°Join me on this data-driven journey as we delve into the results and unveil actionable insights for enhancing subscription strategies.

About the company

Best media company is a fictional American based news media outlet with a strong presence in digital media.  The company has a mobile app with over 200 million users who they provide daily contents on news, sports, global issues, and whats trending in America. This mobile app has two forms of users. Users who us the free basic package and get limited contents and users who use the premium package of $20 a month subscription.
 
üè¢ Business Scenario:

Best Media is currently experiencing a decline in subscription and renewal rates. To address this, the product manager proposes implementing a free 7-day trial of the premium package to attract users and boost subscriptions. He believes that by offering this free trial, users will have an insight on the features of the premium package and thus start buying and renewing their package. Best media‚Äôs data team, consisting of data analysts and scientists, has been tasked with assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.


üìùStatistical framework

Alpa: 0.05
Statistical power: 0.8
MDE: 1%
Success matrix: Subscription renewal rate (no of sub_renewal / no of users)
Target population: Active users
Duration of Experiment: 21 days
Sample size: 10,000 from each group
Control group: No free trial
Treatment group: free Trial

 
Conclusion

Since the p-value (0.0000) is less than the significance level (alpha = 0.05) we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that offering a 7-day free trial of the premium subscription plan does not lead to a higher subscription renewal rate compared to not offering any free trial. The results suggest that there is a significant difference in subscription renewal rates between the two groups (offering a free trial vs. not offering a free trial), and this difference is in favour of not offering any free trial.

Recommendation

In light of these findings, the following recommendations where made:
1. To optimize the overall quality of the application and elevate user satisfaction, it is imperative to diligently address existing performance issues, such as eliminating delays in loading time and minimizing instances of app crashes. Enhancing the app's smooth functionality will undoubtedly elevate the overall user experience, fostering an increased rate of subscriptions and customer retention.
2. Significantly enhancing the premium feature is vital to compelling users to not only purchase plans but also ensure subscription renewal. This can be achieved by meticulously tailoring content to meet individual user preferences, while also optimizing the interface for intuitive usability. Moreover, granting premium users more expanded access to exclusive content will further incentivize them to invest in and maintain premium subscriptions.
3.  Implementing a compulsory survey during the cancellation process is of utmost importance. This strategic measure will serve to gather valuable insights into the reasons behind users' decision to cancel their plans, enabling us to discern patterns and identify areas of improvement. Armed with this essential feedback, we can proactively implement measures to mitigate cancellations and enhance overall user satisfaction.
By earnestly addressing these critical areas for improvement, we are poised to not only bolster our application's performance and premium offerings but also ensure a more profound understanding of our users' needs, consequently fortifying our position in the market and solidifying long-term customer loyalty.
